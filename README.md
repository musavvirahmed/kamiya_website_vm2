Squarespace, as unappealing as it maybe to a UI designer, has its place.

Recently, my product-manager colleague chose to opt for a [Squarespace powered landing page](https://kamiya.io/), not before exploring a completely-static & various headless-CMS options.

â€¢ The static [site we didn't go for](https://musavvirahmed.github.io/kamiya_website_vm2)  
â€¢ This repo also contains its ðŸ’ŽSketch design files.
